# Modified-Tic-Tac-Toe-COMRO1-MP-
This game is a variant of Tic-tac-toe called "Three board tic-tac-toe misere mode". In this mode, two players takes turns placing markers on 3 boards.
When a space is marked, the space can no longer be marked. When a line forms in a board, the board is considered "dead" and spaces on the board could no longer be marked.
When all the board are dead, the player who killed the last board will lose and the other player wins.
